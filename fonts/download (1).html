        <p class="lead text-justify">If you've ever dealt with online video downloaders, you must know the drill, you probably aren't even reading this and are long gone doing your own thing.. 
            But if you never seen such a site before, here I am to explain how to use it in 4 easy steps. We made <a class="text-warning" href=/>Vimeo Mp4 Downloader</a> purely for our group of friends, 
            so it is very simple and straight-forward. The site performs 2 functions. One - help users <strong>download videos from vimeo</strong>. And Two - convert occasional music video from 
            Vimeo to mp3. That's all. Granted, you always need a Video Link to begin. Here's a <a class=text-warning href=https://help.vimeo.com/hc/en-us/articles/229326167-Share-features target=__blank>good quick 
            article</a> explaining how to get that Link.. Then you bring link here and put it in the box above, press Submit and begin the download. For those better visual learners, here's a quick 4-step diagram:</p>

        <p class="text-justify">They made me write this, I write things for our group of friends. So if you are more like me - the step by step kinda guy - here's a quick write up of things
              to do to successfully download video from <strong>vimeo to mp4</strong>... first, here's the action+key-strokes algorithm, the keys I personally would hit and press and actions i would take to
              get the job done and download <em>My Video</em> from Vimeo on my AMD PC..</p>
        <h3 class="text-left text-truncate">How to get video Link from Vimeo on Windows using Google Chrome and keyboard (only)</h3>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
            Open Google Chrome, press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to open new tab. Type in <kbd>vimeo.com</kbd> and press 
            <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. Navigate to <em>My Video</em>. Press <kbd>F6</kbd> to focus on address bar (where Video Link will be). Then press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to <em>Copy 
            Video Link</em> into Clipboard. Now press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to open new browser tab & type in <kbd>vimeo-downloader.com</kbd>. <span class=text-warning>You can also bookmark our site or use our 
            bookmark-let to be sent here right from Vimeo..</span> Hit <kbd>TAB</kbd> x4 (four times) OR simply click in the White Box. Press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to <em>Paste Video Link</em>. 
            Now press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> or click SUBMIT. Download <em>My Video</em> from Vimeo on the next page.
            </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            As you may now concur, it is quite easy to use <a class=text-white href=/>Vimeo-Downloader.com</a>. Of course I don't have to use keyboard. It's quite fast to use mouse, and mouse only. 
            Here's what I'd do, if I were required not to touch my keys.. I like keys... I am also assuming both Vimeo and Vimeo Downloader are in the Browser Bookmarks. To bookmark
            a website press <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>+<kbd>ENTER</kbd> or grab its address in the address bar and drag it to the Bookmarks section of your Browser... 
            </p>
        <h3 class="text-left text-truncate">How to get Vimeo video Link on Windows using Google Chrome and mouse (no keyboard)</h3>
        <p class="lead text-justify">
            Click on Vimeo.com in Browser Bookmarks. Find <em>My Video</em> on Vimeo. If <em>My Video</em> is in some feed, I 
            Right Click on video and select Copy Link Address in the menu. If video is on its own page, I Right-Click in the browser address bar and select Copy. Or I click <u><i class="fas fa-paper-plane"></i> Share</u>
            button, then click in the Link box. Text is auto-selected, or I manually select it with mouse. Now I Right Click on selected text in the same box, and pick Copy from the menu. The remaining 
            is to click New Tab icon, click on Vimeo-Downloader.com in bookmarks to open the site. Right Click in the white box, select Paste in the context menu. Click on SUBMIT button. 
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Instructions to copy Vimeo video Link URL on Android are exactly the same. If using browser, replace <em>click for Tap</em> and <em>Right-Click for Tap & Hold</em>... 
            So it will read "Tap & Hold on the video, select Copy (or doubling copy icon) in the menu that pops up. Or tap & hold on the browser address bar, in the menu tap Select All or its icon, 
            then tap Copy or its icon, navigate to .., Tap & Hold in the White Box, select Paste, usually the only option, Tap SUBMIT". If using vimeo app, look for Share button, tap it, a Standard
            Share Menu with contacts, emails and earlier ways will show, find Copy To Clipboard option and tap that. Then back to browser and act from there...

            <h2 class="text-center mb-3">About this project</h2>
            <p class="text-justify lead">
                We are a group of video enthusiasts from all around the world, who happen to like <a class=text-dark href=https://vimeo.com>vimeo</a> quite a lot. There is so much to see in this 
                world, and a serious chunk of it is on vimeo. People share lots of exciting stuff there, rendered or live. We use vimeo to share short video clips between our group.
                Sometimes we like to work together on the same videos, add parts to them, etc. We needed an easy way to download video from different accounts on vimeo. After 
                looking around online we realized, while sites claimed to be vimeo downloaders, - <em>none actually worked</em>. And so we decided to make our own centralized portal to 
                help us download videos from vimeo. And make it as easy as possible for others to use it too. So here we are... And you're here. Hello and welcome! :) Thanks for reading this. 
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                We're not looking to earn money from this, we are just here to use this site as much as anyone else can. And now you can too. Enjoy! We don't promise anything but one 
                simple thing: since we need this site daily, we will ensure its proper operation daily. 100% guaranteed: you will download your video from vimeo using our site.

        <h2 class="text-center mb-3">Before Contacting...</h2>
        <p class=lead>We know some things may be confusing sometimes.. How site acts, how browser responds.. Here are a few questions that were raised in our group of friends.. Maybe our 
            answers will answer your question?</p>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Question: Why my video shows as AUDIO??? Where is the image???</h4>
        <h5 class="mb-2">Answer: <span class=text-success>GO AHEAD, DOWNLOAD IT!!</span> It is still video!! But your Internet Browser cannot see that, hence represents video as audio... </h5>
        <p class="text-justify">See, the problem is that Vimeo sometimes offers video in HEVC format, which most of browsers (including chrome and firefox) cannot play. As a matter
            of fact, only Safari can play that video well. Try... It's kinda stupid.. Vimeo is catering to Apple... Anyway, even that browser cannot play this file as video, your normal 
            video player like VLC or KMP will have no problems doing that. HEVC format saves a bit on data size without loss of quality, it is supposedly a possible sucessor of currently 
            widely used AVC format... but it's all in the future.. So for now simply trust me, <strong>download the video file</strong> and try play it on your device, - it'll work fine, you'll see..
            If you still don't believe me, - install Safari, run same vimeo link, and see how Safari nicely plays video that Chrome or Firefox cannot. As a matter of fact, <a href=https://caniuse.com/#feat=hevc>here 
            it is shown</a> that only Safari, IE and Edge can play HEVC video format. MS Duo didn't work for me, but Safari did.
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Question: What if video doesn't download but starts streaming instead?</h4>
        <h5 class="mb-2">Answer: Right click on video and select Save Video/Link As; for mobile, Tap & Hold on video, select Save Link when menu pops up</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">If you are on one of those fancy Apple devices like MacOS, or IOS with iPhones and iPads, well, don't blame us, it's Apple that prohibits any 
            normal mp3 and video downloads by the browsers, trying to have iTunes be in the center of it all.. Shame on them.. And you need special apps or browsers that allow file downloads
            even against Apple's wishes.. 
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Question: Is this service free?</h4>
        <h5 class="mb-3">Answer: Yes, it's free and will always be. It's made with love and best https secure intentions.</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">Oh yeah!! we use https, which ensures that none of the internet overlords can see what exactly are you doing on our website, so be sure and do whatever,
            we don't do any tracking, and no outsiders can track your visit here either. You're welcome! =)
        </p>
        <h4 class="mb-3">Question: Who to contact with thanks? Or other questions?</h4>
        <h5 class="mb-3">Answer: Well, if you still have to.. we are happy to hear from you, <a href="mailto:info@vimeo-downloader.com">send us an email</a>.</h5>
